/**
 * @abstract Message observers.
 * @discussion Message observers listen to message events, such as messages
 * being received, sent, delivered, or failing. The concepts of "sending"
 * and "delivering" are important to distinguish. A message being "sent"
 * indicates that it was written to the output streams, but not necessarily
 * develired to it's destination. This only means that the content is 
 * circulating on the network, and as such might not have left the device 
 * yet. A message being "delivered", on the other hand, indicates that its
 * destination has acknowledge reception and the content is already available
 * on the end device. Messages being written to the output streams are indicated
 * by the -hype:didSendMessage:toInstance:progress:complete: event. A message
 * being delivered is indicated by -hype:didDeliverMessage:toInstance:progress:complete:.
 * Hype does not indicate partial reception yet (that is, a didReceive method 
 * with progress tracking), so the end device is only notified when the message
 * is fully received. Other events include messages being received
 * (-hype:didReceiveMessage:fromInstance:) or failed sending
 * (-hype:didFailSendingMessage:toInstance:error:).

 * The instance parameter indicates the originating instance.

 * for this include the destination instance being lost while the content is being
 * sent, causing the output streams to close. Hype does not implement failed delivery
 * notifications yet, meaning that even if this notification is not issued the message
 * may still not reach its destination. The messageInfo (HYPMessageInfo) parameter
 * holds some metadata about the original message. Currently, it only holds the
 * message's identifier, but more data can be used in the future. If the original
 * message was kept, the identifiers can be compared in order to map the event
 * with message's content. This is motivated by the fact that Hype does not keep
 * the message's data in order to save memory.

/**
 * @abstract Notification issued when a message has progressed in being sent.
 * @discussion This notification indicates that the message with the identifier
 * given by the messageInfo parameter has progressed in being sent to the network. 
 * This does not mean that it has been delivered, but rather that it was written 
 * to the streams. As such, the content could still be buffered waiting for output, 
 * meaning that it might not have left the device yet. The delegate method
 * -hype:didDeliverMessage:progress:complete:, on the other hand, indicates delivery
 * to the receiving end. That method is preferred if the intent is to track delivery,
 * especially when messages are being sent over a mesh network and not direct link.
 * At this point, it's not known whether the content has been or will be delivered.
 * The progress indicator yields a number between 0 and 1, indicating the percentage
 * of the message that has been written to the streams. The "complete" boolean 
 * argument indicates whether the message was fully written, in order to avoid
 * floating-point arithmetic. When looking for completion, use this flag instead
 * of using comparison over the progress float. The progress float is intended
 * for implementing loading bars and the likes of it. The messageInfo instance
 * maps to a message identifier of an HYPMessage instance that was returned by
 * the -sendData:toInstance:trackProgress: method. In order to keep track of which
 * messages are sent, store this identifier in a data structure and wait for
 * notifications with the same identifier. This step is, however, optional.
 * @param hype The HYP singleton instance.
 * @param messageInfo Metadata about the message being sent.
 * @param toInstance The destination instance.
 * @param progress Percentage of content of the original message that was written.
 * @param complete Whether the message was fully written to the output streams.
